// This file can be minimal or even empty if your main purpose is to expose federated modules.
// However, it's good practice to have a bootstrap file.
// You could potentially import and render a placeholder or a message indicating this is a remote app.
// For example:
// import('./bootstrap'); // If you want to keep main logic separate

console.log('Remote App (serve-react-app) is running for Module Federation.');
